                            The name makes it sound a bit confusing, but in short: a typical phishing attack occurs when an unethical hacker tries to steal your sensitive information
                            - passwords, credit card details, etc. - in order to steal your money. Many people are easily trapped because they blindly click on insecure links that direct them to a login page, for example, where they are required to enter their username 
                            and/or password. The hacker then saves this informatin to use in the future in order to access the actual website with your credentials.

                            Example:

                        <h4 class="text-center">
                            gmail.com -> update.gmail.com

                            Did you notice the difference? In this case, you should consider the update.google.com to be a malicious websiew because it has
                            extra characters in its name you don't see when visiting their website.

                            Another thing to note is that all secure websites begin with "https://" in their url. A way to check this is to hover
                            over the link that you recieved in your gmail and see the url.

                            Social Engineering Approximately 70-90% of cyberattacks utilize social engineering to get close to their next victim(got information from here). Through social engineering, a hacker can trace your digital footprint(information you leave behind when using the internet; examples include browsing history, online purchases, and Instagram posts). For example, if you have been looking for a company that can set up Christmas lights around your house, a scammer could identify this information and attempt to make you click on a link for a company that just happens to be in business for Christmas lights.
