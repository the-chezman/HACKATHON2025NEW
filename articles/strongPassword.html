                            whether a website is secure by simply looking at the link, great job! Secure passwords are one of the most important things a user can control
                             to prevent phishing attacks. In order to improve the security of your passwords, many websites use a password manager to both generate random passwords that are not related to you in any way and save those passwords. You might have heard of “Google Password Manager” - which is Google's password manager that stores all your passwords for all the websites you used through your Google account.

                            If you are using a Google account for all your websites, Google - through its password manager - gives you the option of choosing a random password when setting up your account. We highly recommend you do that because hackers can also steal your information through techniques such as password cracking (blindly guessing your password until the hacker cracks your password) and guessing (using personal information from social media to get the password). Creating a unique, strong, and complex password using a random password generator/recommendation will quickly eliminate the threat of the hacker from accessing your information. If, for some reason, a website that you want to create an account for does not provide you a random password to sign up, you can navigate to our random password generator in order to get any digit unique code.

                        <h4 class="text-center">If you do end up choosing your own password, here are some of the things to consider: Birthdays are the most commonly chosen passwords, 1234567890 and the entire middle row of keyboard are also easily guessable as they're equally if not more common, and finally adding special characters makes your password more secure - especially if you have a good mix between upper and lowercase characters. </h4>
